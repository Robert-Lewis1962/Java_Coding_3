About Lab: For this lab, we will be building part of a node in the Bitcoin network.  The two main jobs of a node are to keep track of the currently accepted blockchain and any forks, and to validate and track pending transactions and attempt to generate a new valid block containing them. Emphasis will be placed on heaps and priority queues as well as relevant design patterns.
